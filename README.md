**WallWhale** is a server and cli-tool for downloading and hosting Steam
Built with TypeScript, Fastify,
and Prisma, it provides secure API access, multi-account Steam integration,
audit logging, and comprehensive monitoring. The system supports bulk downloads,
automated deployments, and scales horizontally with Docker.
## Important Notices

> [!WARNING]
> **Docker Support Status: Experimental**
> 
> The current Docker implementation is in experimental status. While Docker is supported as a deployment target, functionality has not been fully validated in all environments. Production use is not recommended at this time as it may result in container instability or data integrity issues.

> [!NOTE]
> **Development Status: Active**
> 
> This project is under active development with an evolving API surface. Core functionality and interfaces may undergo significant changes without prior notification. Please consider this when implementing integration solutions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Legal Information**
> 
> - **No Official Affiliation**: WallWhale is an independent project with no affiliation, endorsement, or official connection to Valve Corporation or Steam.
> - **Supported Content**: This tool is specifically optimized for [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) content. While adaptable for other purposes with minor changes, no additional content types are officially supported.
> - **Compliance Requirements**: In accordance with the Steam Subscriber Agreement, WallWhale requires valid credentials and will only download content legitimately owned by or accessible to the provided account. The tool respects and enforces all ownership verification.
> - **User Responsibility**: Users bear sole responsibility for ensuring their legal right to use provided credentials. Project maintainers do not verify credential ownership and assume no liability for credential misuse.



Get started in 60 seconds:

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Local development
git clone https://github.com/MIKTHATGUY/WallWhale/ && cd WallWhale&& npm install && npm run db:push && npm run setup && npm run dev
```

## Core components

**API Server** (`src/index.ts`, `src/routes/`) - Fastify web server with
authentication, rate limiting, and OpenAPI documentation. Handles download
requests, user management, and real-time monitoring endpoints.

**Download Engine** (`src/services/downloadService.ts`, `src/utils/depotDownloader.ts`) -
Orchestrates Steam Workshop downloads using the DepotDownloader binary.
Manages concurrent downloads, queue processing, and retry logic.

**Database Layer** (`prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/plugins/prisma.ts`) - Prisma
ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL support. Stores user accounts, download history,
audit logs, and system configuration.

**Authentication System** (`src/plugins/auth.ts`, `src/utils/crypto.ts`) -
Dual authentication with JWT tokens and API keys. Supports role-based access
control and session management.

**CLI Tools** (`src/commands/`, `src/utils/`) - Command-line interface for
server setup, certificate management, direct downloads, and maintenance
operations.

**File Hosting** (`src/utils/fileHosting.ts`, `src/utils/directDownload.ts`) -
Static file server with password protection, download tracking, and bandwidth
limiting for serving downloaded workshop content.

**Monitoring & Logging** (`src/plugins/audit.ts`, `src/utils/audit.ts`) -
Comprehensive audit logging, Prometheus metrics, health checks, and
structured JSON logging for production observability.

**Security Layer** (`src/utils/certificates.ts`, `src/plugins/register.ts`) -
TLS certificate management, input validation, CORS configuration, and
secure headers for production deployments.

## API workflow

Download a workshop item:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/downloads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workshopId": "123456789", "steamAccount": "account_name"}'
```

Monitor progress:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/downloads/download-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

## Production deployment

Docker Compose with external database:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/wallwhale"
export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```
